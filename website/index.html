        <h2>A story from my childhood</h2>
        <p class="blog-meta">a reflection on my understanding of art & creation</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blog-body">
        <p>Clock hanging on a wall in a room with absence of sunlight had just struck 1o’clock. It was afternoon, sun
          was shining bright overhead, but weather didn’t feel hot, as it was November. My school van had just pulled
          over in front of my house. Driver got out to get me out only to find I was already out, he was not surprised
          though, as it was my usual habit. He picked my bag and me and left me just right in front of the entrance gate
          & pressed the bell.</p>

        <p>“It’s not closed, come in”, a voice yelled, from the roof, it was my mother. I quickly pushed the gate, and
          went inside running, didn’t even care to close it.</p>

        <p>“Mummy!!”, I yelled on the top of my lungs, “mummy see what have I got!”</p>

        <p>“Wait, I’ll be there”, she replied, yelling from roof again.</p>

        <p>I went straight inside the bedroom, threw my backpack on side of the bed, shoes somewhere outside the room,
          probably, and the water bottle on different side of the bed. Didn’t bother to change my dress, already had
          what in my hands what I needed—a dark green piece of chart paper, small sized. I rushed towards my desk and
          took out my pencil colors, sketch pens, and crayons.</p>

        <p>The minute hand barely had moved past one, I was already lying down on the bed, in my iconic style—half body
          on the bed and rest of it hanging along with other leg by the side, suspended in mid air. Despite not knowing
          what “Greeting Card” means, I had already started doodling things that I could, firecrackers, Holi colors,
          greenery (on a green sheet), cars, bikes, even trains, airplane, river, landscape. By the time clock’s minute
          hand reached 4, the green piece of paper was full of the doodles of the things that I’ve ever known.</p>

        <p>“What were you about to show?”, asked my mother. She had just arrived.</p>

        <p>“See!”, in soulful excitement I jumped onto my feet and showed her my creation. She took a look at it,
          smiling with sense of proud and asked, “what’s this? It looks fantastic though.”</p>

        <p>“My class teacher asked all of us students to make a greeting card during the vacations”, I explained in
          excitement.</p>

        <p>“On this paper? Dark green?”</p>

        <p>“Yes”</p>

        <p>“Well! Do you even know what greeting card means?” she asked, with a little disappointment in her voice.</p>

        <p>“That’s what I wanted to ask.”</p>

        <p>“This is great, what you’ve done with it, but it’s not greeting card.”</p>

        <p>I was a little disappointed listening to this, but still the excitement was through the roof, at least I made
          something. A week and half later, I went back to school, presented my creation in front of the class teacher.
        </p>

        <p>“You made this?” she asked, rather surprised by mine than she was with other students. I nodded, full of
          excitement and with a big smile on my face. It was the last year of Kindergarten(UKG). A few days later, we
          had a parents-teacher meeting. Our results of the competition were to be shown there. I was with my mother,
          walking through the corridor towards the classroom, and as we kept walking, I could see many cards hanging by
          the wall like Diwali decoration.</p>

        <p>I was a little disappointed, since I didn’t see my card anywhere and I could see other students card which
          had cartoon faces made from clay, some drawings, decoration, etc. But mine only had doodles, that too
          unrelated. “Good Morning ma’am”, my mother and I said, almost in unison. “Good Morning”, ma’am replied, with a
          big smile, “Shivendra, sweet boy!”</p>

        <p>“Why are you looking sad?”</p>

        <p>“I don’t see my card”, I murmured, while I latched onto my mother’s right arm. My class teacher, she smiled,
          and pulled me closer, and whispered into my ears—why don’t you take a little closer look at the bulletin
          board? I knew something unexpected was about to happen, so a big smile broke out on my face and I ran towards
          her other side and looked up. There it was, my card, and written below—made by shivendrra(a little spelling
          mistake).</p>

        <p>“You’re child is pretty creative”, she told my mother while I at gazed my card. It was in the perfect place
          that I could ever wish for. Most parents wouldn’t even have noticed it, but my class teacher, whom I cared
          about did, and I was placed right there where it mattered, not in some decoration which could be replaced.</p>

        <p>“He's pretty naive, he didn’t know what Greeting card meant”, my mother told her, “he just came back from the
          school, didn’t
          even bother to change….” and the conversation went on for next five minutes explaining each nuance of the act
          that lead to the creation of that so called “masterpiece” which was framed none less than DaVinci’s Mona Lisa.
        </p>

        <p>“I love this thing about him—naiveness, and simply not caring about it, even in the class he does the same,
          despite me telling him to do otherwise”, my teacher explained to my mother, “some of the times he’s right but
          most of the times he learns.”</p>

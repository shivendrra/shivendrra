# About me
Hello, I'm Shivendra. I like to code and make videos. Check out some of my previous work at [Vakya](https://www.youtube.com/@WeAreVakya)

## Main Projects:
1- [SmallLanguageModel](https://github.com/shivendrra/SmallLanguageModel-project) [completed, closed]: Making a LLM from scratch all the way from generating raw training data to tokenizing it, creating a model & then training it.

2- [Enigma](https://github.com/shivendrra/enigma) [completed, closed]: Transformer model trained on raw DNA data to predict the next letter of the DNA.

3- [Axon](https://github.com/delveopers/axon) [completed, updating]: Lightweight multi-dimensional array manipulation library powered by GPU.

4- [Axgrad](https://github.com/shivendrra/axgrad) [completed, updating]: Lightweight ``Tensor`` manipulation library like [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) written in c/c++, cuda & python.

5- [Axon.drop](https://github.com/shivendrra/axon-drop) [completed, closed]: A small & lightweight, experimental ``Tensor`` manipulation library wrapped on top of Scalar level autograd, written in c/c++, cuda & python.

6- [WebGraze](https://github.com/shivendrra/web-graze) [completed, closed]: A Python-based library for scraping data from various sources on the internet. For ML usecases.

7- [Synapse](https://github.com/shivendrra/synapse) [completed, closed]: A free platform for streaming music & audio/podcasts, based on Youtube V3 API.

8- [Micrograd.c](https://github.com/shivendrra/micrograd.c) [completed, closed]: Micrograd by Karpathy written in C & C++.

9- [Tqdm.c](https://github.com/shivendrra/tqdm.c) [completed, closed]: Tqdm library of python for c/c++ code usage.

10- [AVA](https://github.com/shivendrra/AIVA-4x500m) [in progress, backlogged]: A multimodal ai system inspired by AVA from Ex-Machina, but currently more like OpenAi's 4o, (I started working on it prior to the model launch).

11- [Shred](https://github.com/delveopers/shredword) [completed, updating]: Fast & efficient BPE tokenizer written in C & python for LLM tranining.

12- [Enigma2](https://github.com/shivendrra/enigma2) [in progres, backlogged]: Second version of Enigma to predict & classify DNA & proteins more accurately using Transformers.

13- [Biosaic](https://github.com/delveopers/biosaic) [completed, updating]: Tokenizer for DNA & Protein specific ML applications, for Enigma2 specifically and other applicable programs if any.

# About me
Hello, I'm Shivendra. I like to code and make videos. Check out some of my previous work at [Vakya](https://www.youtube.com/@WeAreVakya)

## Main Projects:
1- [SmallLanguageModel](https://github.com/shivendrra/SmallLanguageModel-project) [completed, closed]: Making a LLM from scratch all the way from generating raw training data to tokenizing it, creating a model & then training it.

2- [Enigma-1.5b](https://github.com/shivendrra/enigma-1.5b) [completed, closed]: Transformer model trained on raw DNA data to predict the next letter of the DNA.

3- [Axon](https://github.com/shivendrra/axon) [completed, updating]: Numpy from scratch in python without any external library. Also with a tiny scalar level autograd ``axon.micro``

4- [Axgrad](https://github.com/shivendrra/axgrad) [in progress]: Lightweight ``Tensor`` manipulation library like [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) written in c/c++, cuda & python.

5- [Axon.drop](https://github.com/shivendrra/axon-drop) [in progress]: A small & lightweight, experimental ``Tensor`` manipulation library wrapped on top of Scalar level autograd, written in c/c++, cuda & python.

6- [WebGraze](https://github.com/shivendrra/web-graze) [completed, updating]: A Python-based library for webscraping & generating/downloading data from various sources on the internet for training ml models.

7- [Synapse](https://github.com/shivendrra/synapse) [completed, to be updated]: A free platform for streaming music & audio/podcasts, based on Youtube V3 API.

8- [Micrograd.c](https://github.com/shivendrra/micrograd.c) [completed, no updates]: Micrograd by Karpathy written in C & C++.

9- [Tqdm.c](https://gihub.com/shivendrra/tqdm.c) [completed, no updates]: Tqdm library of python for c/c++ code usage.

10- [AVA](https://github.com/shivendrra/AIVA-4x500m) [in progress, backlogged]: A multimodal ai system inspired by AVA from Ex-Machina, but currently more like OpenAi's 4o, (I started working on it prior to the model launch).

11- [Shred](https://github.com/shivendrra/shredword) [in progress]: BPE tokenizer library using C based code at the backend for fast execution speeds with Python interface for usage.

12- [Enigma2](https://github.com/shivendrra/enigma2) [in progress, backlogged]: Second version of Enigma to predict & classify DNA & proteins more accurately using Transformers.

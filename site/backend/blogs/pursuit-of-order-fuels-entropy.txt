“This sucks, I can’t work on this software. There has to be some alternative to this!”

“There isn’t any.”

“What?? Looks like I’ve to write a new one all by myself,” I said in frustration. “It will have all the components, be super easy to use, and have a great UI.”

“No shit, Sherlock,” my friend scoffed.

Let’s talk entropy. In above conversation, I’m trying to illustrate my reaction towards encountering a problem that I know can be fixed easily with a new product/service/solution.

Entropy, the measure of disorder in a system, naturally increases over time. This is a fundamental principle of thermodynamics, but it applies metaphorically to human systems as well. Every attempt to impose order injects additional elements into the system—new rules, structures, or artifacts—that interact with pre-existing chaos. The more we try to control, the more complex and fragile the system becomes. This fragility often leads to collapse, after which efforts to rebuild it from the ruins restart the cycle anew.

Humans are inherently biased towards certain ideas and approaches, which often conflict with the goal of creating a “perfectly ordered solution” to a problem. When attempting to fix something—whether it’s an idea, a system, or an artifact—we rarely start from scratch. Instead, we base our work on the original, attempting to preserve its essence while addressing its flaws. This approach stems from an unwillingness to discard the familiar or disrupt the system entirely.

For instance, consider a governing political party that has done remarkably well for its people. However, one senior member, Harsh (in this case), believes that monopolistic rule is dangerous. He decides to create an alternative party to provide citizens with another option while maintaining the same core ideologies. Over time, this new party becomes part of a duopoly. Eventually, as corruption seeps into both, others form new parties to “fix” these flaws. What began as an attempt to solve one issue spirals into a landscape of fragmented governance, all tied to the original idea but laden with complexity and disorder.

The same phenomenon can be observed in religions, programming languages, and startups, which in relation are quite different from each other and yet share the same basic property. The pursuit of fixing imperfections, sometimes, creates an illusion of progress while layering more dependencies and complications. Paradoxically, these new iterations often create as much disorder as they resolve, binding systems into webs of interdependence.

Yet, this cycle isn’t inherently negative. The cascading effects of attempting to fix flaws are sometimes necessary. Without a degree of disorder, society would stagnate, unable to grow or evolve. The birth of new alternatives, even if messy, is a driving force for progress.

For example, governance evolves through the replacement of flawed policies with revised ones. While these revisions may inadvertently introduce loopholes or conflicts, they also provide opportunities for further refinement. The resulting disorder, though unsettling, eventually leads to more robust systems through iterative improvement.

However, not every problem needs fixing. The quest for perfection can itself be a source of imperfection. Striving for rigid order often ignores the possibility that some flaws are not detrimental enough to warrant intervention. Accepting a certain level of imperfection allows systems to adapt organically without unnecessary complications.

The desire to fix flaws is intrinsic to human nature— we all love to solve problems, fix things, right? Yet, this desire fuels a phenomenon where each act of creation disrupts the balance of what already exists. Rather than criticizing or praising this cycle, it is crucial to acknowledge its duality. When thoughtfully managed, the interplay of order and entropy enables growth and adaptation. However, unnecessary interventions can exaggerate disorder without meaningful improvement.

By recognizing that order and entropy are not adversaries but companions in a continuous dance, we can approach change with greater intention. Not all imperfections are worth fixing, and some should be left untouched. In this balance lies the potential to navigate the cycle of disorder wisely and preserve the delicate equilibrium of systems we value.

            <p>Started this as a part time project with a friend to make videos related to geopolitics, science,
              economics, business, etc. I handled all of the animation, video editing and motion/graphics design
              parts at the beginning but later started handling all the management tasks too.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>I used Photoshop & Figma for making the designs and some assets and After Effects for making the motion design & animations and at last,
                Audition for recording and editing sound and Premiere Pro to edit all the videos & documentaries</li>
              <li>We were doing it as a part time thing, even though I wanted to do it full time but couldn't because of school & all, we still managed to get descent views and got famous among my classmates.
                Even Mohak Mangal, on of the inspirations behind this thing saw our videos and personally dm'd me appreciating our content.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For now, I & my friend has stopped posting because we are invloved in some personal matters, but I've plans to restart it soon as possible. And this time it would be better than before, at least 10x.</p>

            <p>It's my Nana's Company, which I decided to join for the summers during my gap year to learn intricacies of business and manufacturing. Mostly assisted my Nana & Mama with the software & accounting
              & in return they taught me about various machines like transfomers, stabilizers & some small circuit components like arduino & control boards.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Worked on ERP software for accounting and management related tasks. Beside working on it, I learnt about various business softwares and even tried to
                build one myself, designed the ui in Figma and started coding it using ReactJS & NodeJS, but couldn't continue it for very long as I skipped to ML.</li>
              <li>I was learning ui/ux designing in the free time, so I decided to design the website for them and build it using React & NodeJS.
                Also designed the brochures/catalogues & business cards for an upcoming showcase event.</li>
